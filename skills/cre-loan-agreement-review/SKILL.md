  Comprehensive skill for reviewing commercial real estate loan agreements
  (both single-asset and portfolio transactions). Covers the most commonly
  negotiated provisions in CRE mortgage loan agreements with lender and
  borrower positions, market benchmarks, and analysis frameworks. Derived

# CRE Loan Agreement Review Skill

This skill provides market benchmarks and negotiation guidance for the most
heavily negotiated provisions in commercial real estate mortgage loan agreements.
It is organized by provision, with each section identifying the lender's
preferred position, the borrower's desired position, and a market benchmark
reflecting well-negotiated institutional transactions.

> **Usage Note:** When reviewing a loan agreement, identify each provision below
> and compare the draft language against the market benchmark. Flag deviations
> in either direction. For borrower-side reviews, prioritize pushing toward the
> borrower's desired position on the highest-impact items first (extension
> conditions, cash sweep triggers, non-recourse carveouts, transfer restrictions).

## 1. Extension Options

### Lender's Desired Position
- No extension options, or a single extension option at lender's sole discretion.
- Full re-underwriting required at extension, including new appraisal, updated
  environmental, new title, rating agency confirmation (if securitized).
- Stringent financial tests with no ability to buy down or cure: high debt yield
  thresholds (e.g., 9–10% combined), DSCR floors (1.10x–1.15x), and LTV
  caps (60% or lower).
- Extension fee of 0.50% or greater of the outstanding principal balance.
- No default of any kind (including non-monetary defaults) at either exercise
  or commencement.
- No right to revoke extension notice once delivered.
- Lender approval of replacement interest rate cap counterparty in its sole
  discretion.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- Two (2) extension options of one (1) year each, exercisable as of right
  upon satisfaction of objective conditions.
- Financial tests with a "pay-down" cure: if debt yield or DSCR thresholds
  are not met, borrower may prepay a portion of the loan (or post cash
  collateral) to satisfy the test.
- Moderate financial test thresholds: combined debt yield of 8.0%–8.5% for
  the first extension and 8.5%–9.0% for the second; combined DSCR of
  1.00x for the first extension and 1.05x for the second; combined LTV
  not exceeding 65%.
- Extension fee no greater than 0.25% of the outstanding principal balance.
- Only Event of Default or monetary Default (not all defaults) blocks exercise.
- Notice period with right to revoke (borrower pays lender's out-of-pocket
  costs on revocation).
- Replacement interest rate cap from an "Acceptable Counterparty" (defined
  by objective rating criteria, with lender approval as an alternative).
- Extension notice window: not earlier than 120 days and not later than
  30 days before the then-current maturity date.
- Bring-down of representations allowed to reflect passage of time, provided
  updates do not disclose covenant breaches or Events of Default.

### Market Benchmark
Well-negotiated institutional CRE loans typically include two (2) one-year
extension options with the following conditions:
- **No Event of Default or monetary Default** at exercise and commencement.
- **Extension fee:** 0.25% of the outstanding principal balance per extension.
- **Financial tests (with pay-down cure):**
  - Combined Debt Yield: 8.5% (first extension), 9.0% (second extension).
  - Combined DSCR: 1.00:1 (first extension), 1.05:1 (second extension).
  - Combined LTV: not exceeding 65%.
- **Replacement interest rate cap** from an Acceptable Counterparty with a
  strike price no greater than the original strike price.
- **Notice window:** 30–120 days before the then-current maturity date,
  with revocation rights (borrower pays lender's costs).
- **Officer's certificate** confirming accuracy of representations (with
  updates permitted for passage of time).
- **KYC/AML refresh** as required by lender's then-current policies.
- If mezzanine debt exists, it must be simultaneously extended.

---

## 2. Prepayment and Exit Fee

### Lender's Desired Position
- Full lockout for an initial period (12–24 months or longer), followed by
  yield maintenance or defeasance through the loan term.
- Exit fee of 0.50%–1.00% on any prepayment (including at maturity).
- Exit fee payable on casualty/condemnation prepayments without deferral.
- Prepayment notice irrevocable once delivered.
- No partial prepayment except in connection with mandatory prepayment
  events (casualty, condemnation).
- Prepayment after default includes yield maintenance, exit fee, and
  default rate interest.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- Short or no lockout period; open prepayment after initial yield maintenance
  period expires.
- Exit fee of 0.25%–0.45%, with deferral (not waiver) for casualty and
  condemnation prepayments.
- Exit fee reduced or waived if lender refinances the loan (lender refinance
  loan).
- Prepayment notice revocable, with borrower paying lender's reasonable
  out-of-pocket costs on revocation or adjournment.
- Partial prepayment permitted for extension test compliance and individual
  property release.
- No yield maintenance or prepayment penalty on mandatory prepayments from
  casualty/condemnation proceeds (other than post-default).
- 30-day notice period (not 60 or 90 days).

### Market Benchmark
- **Lockout:** Initial period through a specified date (often 12–24 months
  post-closing), during which voluntary prepayment requires a yield
  maintenance payment.
- **After lockout:** Open prepayment with payment of the exit fee.
- **Exit fee:** 0.45% of the amount prepaid, applicable to both voluntary
  and involuntary prepayments. Deferred (not waived) for casualty and
  condemnation prepayments. Reduced for lender refinance loans.
- **Yield maintenance:** Payable only during the lockout period. Not payable
  on mandatory prepayments from casualty/condemnation proceeds (other than
  post-default).
- **Prepayment notice:** 30 days, revocable (borrower pays lender's
  out-of-pocket costs).
- **Partial prepayment:** Permitted for individual property release, extension
  test compliance (DSCR/debt yield cure), and mandatory prepayment events.
- **Post-default prepayment:** Includes default rate interest, yield
  maintenance (if within lockout), and exit fee.

## 3. Cash Management and Cash Sweep

### Lender's Desired Position
- Hard lockbox from closing: all revenue deposited directly into lender-
  controlled account, swept daily.
- Cash sweep triggered by any default (not just Event of Default).
- Cash sweep triggered by low DSCR test (e.g., below 1.30x or 1.25x).
- No cure rights for cash sweep events, or cure only with lender consent
  in sole discretion.
- Post-default: lender applies all funds in any order in its sole discretion,
  including reserves.
- Manager's payroll and operating expenses paid only at lender's discretion
  during default.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- Soft lockbox: revenue flows to operating account; surplus transferred to
  cash management account after payment of operating expenses per approved
  budget.
- Cash sweep triggered only by Event of Default, manager bankruptcy (if
  affiliated), or DSCR trigger event (at a lower threshold, e.g., 1.10x
  or 1.15x).
- Objective cure rights for each cash sweep trigger:
  - Event of Default: cure accepted by lender (may be in lender's discretion).
  - Manager bankruptcy: replacement with qualified manager.
  - DSCR trigger: achievement of required DSCR for two consecutive quarters.
  - Mezzanine loan default: cure accepted by mezzanine lender.
- Cap on number of permitted cures per category (typically 3–5 during
  the loan term).
- Post-default: lender must continue to pay taxes, insurance, ground rent,
  payroll, and essential operating expenses from the cash management account
  before applying to debt (until a "priority payment cessation event" such
  as foreclosure initiation or acceleration).
- Borrower retains access to operating account for budgeted expenses absent
  an Event of Default.
- Peg balance (working capital) retained in operating account.
- Hotel pass-through income (guest deposits, advance bookings, gift
  certificates) excluded from lender's post-default sweep.

### Market Benchmark
- **Structure:** Operating accounts maintained by borrower/operating lessee;
  surplus funds transferred monthly to lender-controlled cash management
  account. Lender has sole dominion and control over the cash management
  account.
- **Cash management waterfall (no default):**
  1. Basic carrying costs reserves (taxes, insurance, ground rent).
  2. Debt service payment.
  3. Other amounts due under loan documents (excluding principal).
  4. FF&E reserve.
  5. Interest and operating expense reserve.
  6. Mezzanine debt service (if applicable).
  7. During cash sweep period: excess cash flow to excess cash flow reserve.
  8. Outside cash sweep period: excess cash flow released to borrower.
- **Cash sweep triggers:** (a) Event of Default; (b) bankruptcy of affiliated
  manager; (c) DSCR trigger event (combined DSCR below 1.20:1); (d) mezzanine
  loan default (if applicable).
- **Cure rights:** Cure permitted up to 3–5 times during the loan term, with
  borrower paying lender's reasonable costs for each cure. Specific cure
  mechanisms:
  - EOD: Lender acceptance of cure (sole discretion).
  - Manager bankruptcy: Replacement with qualified manager.
  - DSCR trigger: Achievement of specified DSCR for two consecutive quarters
    (a "DSCR Yield Cure").
  - Mezzanine default: Mezzanine lender acceptance of cure.
- **Post-default protections:** Even after an Event of Default, lender
  continues to pay taxes, insurance, ground rent, payroll for property
  employees, and essential housekeeping from cash management account
  until a Priority Payment Cessation Event (acceleration + foreclosure
  commencement or receiver appointment).
- **Hotel pass-through income** excluded from post-default sweep.
- **Peg balance** (monthly working capital) retained in operating account.

---

## 4. DSCR and Debt Yield Tests

### Lender's Desired Position
- DSCR trigger at 1.25x or higher; debt yield trigger at 8% or higher.
- Tests measured on trailing twelve months (TTM), with no adjustments
  favorable to borrower.
- NOI calculated with deductions for management fees at market rate (3–4%),
  FF&E reserves at 4%–5% of gross income, and franchise fees.
- No DSCR yield cure or pay-down option.
- Tests measured quarterly.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- DSCR trigger at 1.10x–1.15x; lower debt yield trigger.
- NOI calculated with exclusions for interest on credit accounts; management
  fees at actual (not assumed); franchise fees at actual (not assumed).
- FF&E reserves deducted at the greater of (a) actual FF&E reserve amount
  under franchise agreement and (b) a specified percentage (e.g., 4%) of
  gross income, but without duplication of actual replacement expenditures.
- DSCR yield cure: borrower can cure by achieving required DSCR/debt yield
  for two consecutive quarters.
- Pay-down cure for extension tests: borrower can prepay loan (or post cash
  collateral) to achieve required thresholds.
- Tests measured quarterly (not monthly).

### Market Benchmark
- **DSCR trigger (cash sweep):** Combined DSCR below 1.20:1, measured
  quarterly.
- **DSCR cure:** Achievement of specified combined DSCR of a specified
  threshold (e.g., 1.25:1) for two consecutive quarters.
- **Debt yield (extension test):** Combined Debt Yield of 8.5% (first
  extension), 9.0% (second extension). If not met, borrower may prepay
  or post cash collateral.
- **Debt yield (spread increase):** Combined Debt Yield of 7.5% as of a
  specified date (e.g., 24 months post-closing). If not met, spread
  increases by 25 bps.
- **NOI calculation:** Excludes interest on credit accounts; uses the greater
  of (a) actual management fees and (b) assumed 3% of gross income from
  operations; uses the greater of (a) actual FF&E reserves under franchise
  agreement and (b) a specified FF&E percentage of gross income (without
  duplication); and deducts franchise fees.
- **DSCR calculation:** Uses actual debt service (not stressed rate) on
  the loan (and mezzanine loan if combined test).

## 5. Non-Recourse Carveouts (Exculpation)

### Lender's Desired Position
- Expansive list of "bad boy" carveouts triggering full recourse to
  borrower and guarantor.
- Loss carveouts broadly drafted to capture any loss "arising out of or
  in connection with" the triggering event, including consequential damages.
- Full recourse triggers include: voluntary bankruptcy, SPE violations
  (without substantive consolidation requirement), unauthorized transfers,
  unauthorized liens, unauthorized indebtedness.
- All carveouts joint and several between borrower and guarantor.
- No materiality, knowledge, or cure qualifiers on carveouts.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- **Loss carveouts** (damages limited to actual loss): fraud, intentional
  misrepresentation, gross negligence, willful misconduct, intentional
  physical waste, misappropriation of insurance proceeds/condemnation
  awards/rents/reserves, failure to pay mechanics' lien claims, failure
  to maintain interest rate cap, SPE violations.
- **Full recourse triggers** (entire debt becomes recourse) narrowly
  limited to: voluntary bankruptcy by a loan party or principal;
  collusive involuntary bankruptcy; SPE violation *only if cited as a
  factor in a substantive consolidation order*; unauthorized transfer
  of property or equity collateral; unauthorized mortgage or mezzanine
  debt lien; franchise agreement termination.
- Exclusion of special, consequential, and punitive damages from loss
  carveouts (except to extent lender must pay such damages to third
  parties).
- Carveout for physical waste should exclude waste caused by insufficient
  cash flow.
- Carveout for mechanics' liens should exclude situations where (a)
  sufficient specifically-allocated reserve funds exist, (b) lender's
  access to such funds was not constrained by borrower, and (c) lender
  failed to make payment.
- Carveout for interest rate cap should be a loss carveout, not full
  recourse.
- No full recourse for mere failure to deliver transfer notice (only for
  the actual unauthorized transfer itself).
- Good faith defense preserved: borrower/guarantor not liable under
  "obstruction of remedies" carveout for defenses raised in good faith.

### Market Benchmark
**Loss carveouts** (liability limited to actual damages, excluding special/
consequential/punitive damages except to extent paid to third parties):
1. Fraud or intentional misrepresentation.
2. Gross negligence or willful misconduct.
3. Intentional physical waste (excluding waste caused by insufficient
   cash flow).
4. Removal of furniture/fixtures/equipment not replaced in the ordinary
   course.
5. Misappropriation or conversion of insurance proceeds, condemnation
   awards, rents, advance rents, operating account funds, and any
   earn-out or similar payments.
6. Failure to pay mechanics' lien charges (with reserve fund carveout:
   no liability if sufficient specifically-allocated reserves exist and
   lender failed to apply them).
7. Interest rate cap default or failure to maintain.
8. Obstruction or opposition to lender's exercise of remedies (with good
   faith defense preserved).
9. Unauthorized franchise agreement or rebranding.
10. SPE violations (including pre-closing SPE failures and liabilities
    arising from pre-closing conduct).
11. Voluntary unauthorized indebtedness, lien, or transfer that does not
    trigger full recourse.
12. Insurance deductible amounts.
13. Franchise agreement termination costs (de-identification, re-branding,
    PIP costs, economic harm from delay).
14. Manager breach of assignment of management agreement obligations.

**Full recourse triggers** (entire debt becomes recourse):
1. Voluntary bankruptcy by loan party or principal.
2. Collusive involuntary bankruptcy.
3. SPE violation **cited as a factor** by the court in a substantive
   consolidation order.
4. Unauthorized mortgage/mezzanine debt lien on property or equity collateral.
5. Unauthorized transfer of property, equity collateral, or interest in a
   restricted party (but not mere failure to deliver notice, standing alone).
6. Franchise agreement termination (other than by lender) without consent.
7. Guarantor failure to pay franchise liquidated damages.
8. Loan party or affiliate acquisition of mezzanine loan interest.
9. Minimum ownership/control test violation.
10. Voluntary ground lease termination or rejection in bankruptcy without
    lender consent.

### Lender's Desired Position
- No transfers of any kind without lender's prior written consent (sole
  discretion).

  that do not change control.
- Consent required only for transfers of direct interest in borrower or
  operating lessee, or transfers resulting in a change of control.
- Qualified transferee/assumption right (with conditions).
- Prohibited competitor protections: lender cannot assign 51%+ of loan
  to a prohibited competitor; borrower can update the prohibited
  competitor list annually.

### Market Benchmark
- **No assumption** of the loan.
- **Prohibited without consent:** Direct transfer of any property or equity
  collateral; PACE loans; any transfer resulting in a change of control.
- **Permitted without consent (but with 30-day prior notice for transfers
  of 10%+ interests):** Transfers of indirect interests in mezzanine
  borrower or restricted parties (other than direct interest in borrower
  or operating lessee) where:

- **Minimum ownership/control test:** Specified parties must maintain a
  minimum direct or indirect ownership percentage and control throughout
  the loan term. Satisfaction of the test is a condition to closing and
  a continuing covenant.
- **Eligibility requirements** for any replacement controlling party: total
  assets in excess of a specified threshold (e.g., $3B+) and operational
  experience in the property type (e.g., 8,000+ hotel rooms under
  management).

---

## 7. Interest Rate Cap Requirements

### Lender's Desired Position
- Initial cap from closing; replacement cap required for each extension.
- Counterparty must be rated A+ / A1 or better (long-term unsecured debt
  rating).
- Strike price at or below the stressed rate used in underwriting.
- If counterparty is downgraded, immediate replacement required (5 business
  days).
- Cap must be collaterally assigned to lender with full legal opinions.
- No "Substitute Interest Rate Cap Agreement" concept (only full
  replacement).

### Borrower's Desired Position
- Acceptable counterparty defined by objective rating criteria, with
  lender approval as a fallback (for counterparties that don't meet
  ratings but are otherwise creditworthy).
- Strike price: 5% or higher (higher strike = lower premium cost).
- Longer cure period for downgrade (10–30 business days).
- On downgrade, multiple cure options: (a) replace cap, (b) obtain
  guaranty from qualifying affiliate of counterparty, or (c) cause
  counterparty to post collateral securing obligations.
- Substitute interest rate cap permitted (caps that don't meet all
  formal requirements but provide substantially equivalent protection).
- For extension: replacement cap need only cover through the end of the
  interest period in which the extended maturity date occurs (not through
  the full extension term plus buffer).
- Legal opinions "as reasonably required by lender" (not any opinion
  lender may demand).

### Market Benchmark

  least the equivalent of "A+" from S&P (or equivalent from Moody's/Fitch),
  or (b) otherwise approved by lender.

- **Substitute interest rate cap** permitted if it meets substantially
  similar economic terms.
- **Extension caps:** Replacement cap required if existing cap expires
  before the extended maturity date.
- **Failure to maintain:** Constitutes both an Event of Default and a
  loss carveout (personal liability for actual damages).

---

### Lender's Desired Position
- Upfront reserves at closing for taxes, insurance, FF&E, interest,
  and operating expenses.
- Monthly deposits into all reserves from day one.
- FF&E reserve at 5% of gross income from operations.

- All reserves applied to debt upon default, in lender's sole discretion.
- No investment earnings credited to borrower.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- Upfront reserves limited or waived if no cash sweep event exists.

  taxes, insurance premiums, ground rent, and assessments. Ongoing
  throughout the loan term.

  amount required under the approved franchise agreement, and (b) a
  specified percentage (typically 4%) of gross income from operations
  for the applicable period.
- **Interest and operating expense reserve:** Upfront deposit of a
  specified number of months (e.g., 3–6 months) of debt service and
  operating expenses. Replenished if drawn below threshold.

  All excess cash flow (after payment of items higher in the waterfall)
  deposited into the reserve. Released upon cash sweep event cure.
- **Special-purpose reserves:** Transaction-specific reserves (e.g., for
  pending litigation, earn-out payments, or franchise transition costs)
  with defined release conditions.

- Remaining portfolio must satisfy stringent financial tests post-release
  (DSCR, debt yield, LTV).
- Rating agency confirmation required (if securitized).
- Full exit fee and yield maintenance payable on release prepayment.
- Release price based on lender's appraisal or underwritten value (not

  property (typically 105%–125% of the allocated loan amount, as specified
  in a schedule).

  - No Event of Default.
  - Prepayment treated as voluntary (exit fee, interest through end of
    interest period, and yield maintenance if within lockout period all
    payable).
  - Remaining loan parties continue to be SPEs.

## 10. Default Provisions and Cure Periods

### Lender's Desired Position
- Short cure periods: 5 days for monetary defaults, 15 days for
  non-monetary defaults.
- No cure period for transfer violations, bankruptcy, or SPE breaches.
- Automatic acceleration upon insolvency events.
- Broad cross-default with all other loan documents and mezzanine loan.
- Default rate: 5%+ above the applicable rate.
- Late payment charge: 5% of the delinquent amount.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- Monetary defaults: 7–10 business day cure period after written notice.
- Non-monetary defaults: 30-day cure period after notice, extendable for
  an additional 60–90 days if diligently pursuing cure.
- Transfer violations: 10 business day cure for failure to deliver notice
  (not the transfer itself); notice failure alone does not constitute an
  Event of Default.
- SPE breaches: 30-day cure for inadvertent, non-recurring, curable
  breaches, plus right to deliver supplemental insolvency opinion.
- Financial statement delivery default: 10 business days after notice
  (not immediate default).
- Involuntary bankruptcy: 90-day dismissal period before constituting
  an Event of Default.
- No cross-default to mezzanine loan (mezzanine default triggers cash
  sweep, not mortgage default).
- Default rate: 3%–5% above the applicable rate.
- Late payment charge: 4% of the delinquent amount (lesser of 4% or
  maximum legal rate).

### Market Benchmark
- **Monetary defaults:**
  - Principal/interest/maturity payments: No cure period.
  - Other monetary obligations (reserve deposits, etc.): 7 business days
    after written notice.
- **Non-monetary defaults:**
  - Transfer violations: Immediate Event of Default (but notice failure
    alone not an EOD if cured within 10 business days of borrower
    obtaining actual knowledge).
  - SPE breaches: 30-day cure for inadvertent, non-recurring, curable
    breaches; right to deliver supplemental insolvency opinion.
  - Representations/warranties: 30-day cure if unintentional and curable,
    plus additional 90 days if cure commenced and diligently pursued.
  - Negative covenants (Section 5.2): 10-day cure after actual knowledge.
  - Franchise agreement default/termination: 60-day replacement period.
  - Management agreement default: Cure period per the management agreement
    terms.
  - Financial statement delivery: 10 business days after written notice
    (triggers cash sweep immediately; Event of Default only if uncured
    after notice).
  - General catch-all: 10 business days (monetary) or 30 days (non-
    monetary) after notice, with additional 75 days if cure commenced
    and diligently pursued.
- **Insolvency events:**
  - Voluntary bankruptcy: Immediate Event of Default (also full recourse
    trigger).
  - Involuntary bankruptcy (not consented to): 90-day dismissal period.
  - Guarantor bankruptcy: 90-day dismissal period; lender has option
    whether to treat as Event of Default.
- **Default rate:** 5% above the applicable rate (on entire outstanding
  balance, calculated from due date without regard to cure periods).
- **Late payment charge:** Lesser of 4% or the maximum legal rate.
- **Automatic acceleration:** Bankruptcy/insolvency events only. All other
  Events of Default require lender election to accelerate.

---

## 11. Spread Increase Event

### Lender's Desired Position
- Spread increase of 50+ bps triggered by failure to meet debt yield
  threshold at an early test date (12–18 months post-closing).
- Spread increase permanent and non-reversible.
- Multiple step-ups at progressive dates.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- Spread increase of 15–25 bps only.
- Test date at 24+ months post-closing (allows more time for stabilization).
- Debt yield threshold achievable under reasonable market conditions (7.0%–7.5%).
- Spread increase reversible if debt yield subsequently achieved.
- No spread increase if borrower makes a voluntary prepayment to cure.

### Market Benchmark
- **Trigger:** If, as of a specified date (typically 24 months post-closing),
  the combined debt yield does not equal or exceed 7.5%.
- **Consequence:** Spread increases by 25 basis points for each payment
  date from the trigger date through the remainder of the loan term
  (including extensions).
- **Non-reversible** in most institutional transactions.

## 12. Insurance, Casualty, and Condemnation

### Lender's Desired Position

  12–24 months of maturity.
- Business interruption insurance for 18–24 months.
- Insurance maintained with carriers rated A/VIII or better by A.M. Best.
- Terrorism insurance (TRIA) required.
- Named storm/windstorm coverage with separate deductible cap.

### Borrower's Desired Position

  adequate proceeds; restoration feasible; adequate time before maturity).
- Restoration permitted up to 6 months before maturity (not 12–24 months).
- Business interruption insurance for 12 months (lower premium).
- Carrier rating: A-/VII or better (broader pool of carriers).
- Deductible caps reasonable and consistent with market practice.
- Excess/umbrella coverage permitted to satisfy requirements.
- Casualty retainage released as restoration progresses.
- If net proceeds insufficient, borrower may deposit shortfall and proceed
  with restoration.

### Market Benchmark
- **Restoration conditions (typically objective, as of right):**
  - No Event of Default.
  - Restoration can be completed at least 6–12 months before maturity.
  - Proceeds (plus borrower deposits) sufficient to cover restoration.
  - Restoration will restore the property to at least its pre-casualty
    condition, value, and cash flow.
  - All required permits obtainable.
  - Franchise agreement remains in effect.
- **Retainage:** 10% of net proceeds held until completion.
- **Business interruption:** 12–18 months of coverage.
- **Terrorism insurance:** Required (TRIA coverage).
- **Named storm/windstorm:** Separate coverage required for coastal
  properties; deductible capped (typically 3%–5% of total insurable
  value per occurrence).

## 13. Franchise and Management Agreement Protections

### Lender's Desired Position
- Approved franchise agreement must remain in effect throughout the loan
  term; termination is an Event of Default and full recourse trigger.
- No amendment, modification, or supplement without lender's prior written
  consent.
- Comfort/recognition letter from franchisor acknowledging lender's rights.
- Replacement management agreement requires lender approval (sole
  discretion).
- Manager subordination and assignment agreements required.
- Lender right to terminate management agreement upon foreclosure.
- All franchise fees, PIP costs, and liquidated damages guaranteed by
  guarantor.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- Termination of franchise agreement by franchisor (not by borrower)
  followed by replacement within 60 days should not be a default.
- Permitted franchise agreement amendments that do not materially adversely
  affect lender.
- Manager replacement with a "qualified manager" (defined by objective
  criteria) with lender's reasonable (not sole) consent.
- Franchise agreement termination by lender upon exercise of remedies:
  all de-identification costs, PIP costs, and re-branding costs are
  loss carveouts borne by guarantor (protecting borrower's non-recourse
  status for other obligations).
- Manager's right to manage preserved unless Event of Default continuing.

### Market Benchmark
- **Franchise agreement termination:** Event of Default if terminated
  (other than by lender or by franchisor), unless replacement franchise
  agreement with an approved franchisor entered into within 60 days.
- **Franchise agreement amendments:** Prohibited without lender consent;
  "Prohibited Franchise Agreement Amendment" constitutes both an Event
  of Default and a recourse carveout.
- **Name change/rebranding:** Event of Default and loss carveout.
- **Franchise termination costs:** Guarantor fully liable for:
  (a) Liquidated damages payable to franchisor (full recourse trigger).
  (b) De-identification, re-branding, and PIP costs (loss carveout).
  (c) Incremental costs of new franchise agreements over existing terms.
- **Management agreement:**
  - Assignment to lender as additional collateral.
  - Manager subordination to loan documents.
  - Replacement with qualified manager requires lender approval.
  - Following Event of Default: no exercise of rights under management
    agreement without lender consent.

## 14. SPE and Separateness Covenants

### Lender's Desired Position
- Full SPE requirements including independent director/manager.
- SPE requirements apply retroactively to all periods prior to closing.
- SPE breach is immediate Event of Default (no cure period) and full
  recourse trigger.
- Annual SPE compliance certificate required.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- SPE breach curable: 30-day cure period for inadvertent, non-recurring
  breaches, plus right to deliver supplemental insolvency opinion.
- SPE breach as full recourse trigger only if the breach is cited as a
  factor by a court in an actual substantive consolidation order.
- Delaware LLC with springing member structure as alternative to
  independent director (no principal required).
- Pre-closing SPE issues disclosed and accepted by lender at closing.

### Market Benchmark
- **SPE requirements:**
  - Single-purpose entity; no commingling of assets; separate books and
    records; arm's-length dealings with affiliates; no dissolution without
    lender consent.
  - Delaware LLCs satisfying specified structural requirements (springing
    member; organizational documents with SPE provisions) may serve as
    borrower without requiring a separate principal/managing member.
- **Cure period:** 30 days for inadvertent, non-recurring, curable SPE
  breaches, provided borrower delivers supplemental insolvency opinion
  confirming no impairment.
- **Loss carveout:** SPE violation is a loss carveout (personal liability
  for actual damages), including any liabilities arising from pre-closing
  conduct.
- **Full recourse trigger:** SPE violation triggers full recourse **only if
  cited as a factor** by the applicable court in a substantive consolidation
  order (unless petitioned by lender).

### Lender's Desired Position
- Ground lease subordination, non-disturbance, and attornment (SNDA) or
  recognition agreement from ground lessor.
- Lender receives copies of all ground lease notices.

  lender's prior written consent.

  (with lender's consent not unreasonably withheld).
- Ground lease estoppel obligation qualified by "commercially reasonable
  efforts" (ground lessor may not cooperate).
- Extended estoppel delivery period for uncooperative ground lessors (e.g.,
  40 days, with no breach if failure is solely due to ground lessor's
  non-compliance).
- Guaranty of ground lease obligations only to extent required by ground
  lessor (not additional lender-imposed guaranty).

### Market Benchmark
- **Recognition agreement:** Required from ground lessor, acknowledging
  lender's interest and providing lender cure rights.
- **Ground lease guaranty:** If required by ground lessor, guaranteed by
  guarantor (separate guaranty).
- **Amendments:** No modification or amendment without lender's prior written
  consent. Voluntary amendment or modification is a loss carveout.
  Voluntary termination or bankruptcy rejection without consent is a full
  recourse trigger.
- **Default:** Ground lease default beyond applicable cure periods is an
  Event of Default.
- **Estoppel certificates:** Within 10 business days of lender's written
  request (no more than once per year unless Event of Default or
  securitization). Extended to 40 days where ground lessor is uncooperative,
  with no borrower breach if failure is solely due to ground lessor.
- **Ground lessor notices:** Lender must receive copies of all default
  notices under the ground lease.

  borrower's obligations or decreases borrower's rights (other than
  de minimis extent).

- Borrower not required to prepare materials not customarily used in
  ordinary course of business.
- Guarantor financial disclosure limited to scope provided at closing.
- Review period: 5 business days for disclosure documents.
- Borrower may adjust securitization certifications to reflect current facts.
- Reasonable precautions against disclosure to competitors.

## 17. Mezzanine Loan Coordination (If Applicable)

### Lender's Desired Position
- No mezzanine debt without lender consent.
- All prepayments of mortgage loan must be accompanied by pro rata
  mezzanine prepayment.
- No prepayment of mezzanine loan without prior or simultaneous mortgage
  loan prepayment.
- Mezzanine loan default triggers cash sweep under mortgage loan.
- Acquisition of mezzanine loan by borrower affiliates is a full recourse
  trigger.
- Intercreditor agreement solely for benefit of senior and mezzanine lender;
  borrower has no third-party beneficiary rights and no right to see its
  terms.

### Borrower's Desired Position
- Mezzanine debt permitted at closing as part of the approved capital
  structure.
- Mezzanine loan default triggers cash sweep only (not mortgage Event
  of Default).
- DSCR and debt yield tests include mezzanine loan in "combined" metrics,
  providing more achievable thresholds.
- Mezzanine lender cure of mezzanine default cures the cash sweep trigger.
- Cash management waterfall prioritizes mezzanine debt service after
  mortgage debt service (fixed position in waterfall).
- If mezzanine loan repaid, "combined" tests convert to "mortgage-only"
  tests with corresponding thresholds.

### Market Benchmark
- **Intercreditor agreement:** Between senior and mezzanine lender; borrower
  has no third-party beneficiary rights.
- **Pro rata prepayment:** Voluntary mortgage prepayment must be accompanied
  by simultaneous pro rata mezzanine prepayment. Mezzanine loan cannot
  be prepaid unless mortgage is simultaneously prepaid in full.
- **Cash management waterfall position:** Mezzanine debt service paid sixth
  in priority (after mortgage debt service, other mortgage loan amounts,
  and FF&E reserves).
- **Financial tests:** Reported on both a "combined" basis (mortgage +
  mezzanine) and a "mortgage-only" basis (if mezzanine is repaid):
  - Combined Debt Yield Requirement: 8.5% (1st ext.) / 9.0% (2nd ext.)
  - Combined DSCR Requirement: 1.00:1 (1st ext.) / 1.05:1 (2nd ext.)
  - Combined LTV: 65% maximum.
  - Mortgage-only thresholds apply if mezzanine is no longer outstanding.
- **Mezzanine default:** Triggers cash sweep only (not mortgage Event of
  Default). Cure by mezzanine lender acceptance cures the cash sweep.
- **Affiliate acquisition:** Loan party or affiliate acquisition of any
  mezzanine loan interest is a full recourse trigger.
- **Extension coordination:** Mezzanine loan must be simultaneously extended
  as a condition to mortgage extension.

## General Analysis Framework

When reviewing any CRE loan agreement, apply the following analysis for each
provision:

1. **Identify the provision** in the draft agreement.
2. **Compare** the draft language to the market benchmark above.
3. **Flag deviations** from market:
   - **Lender-favorable:** Provisions more restrictive than the benchmark.
   - **Borrower-favorable:** Provisions more permissive than the benchmark.
4. **Assess materiality:** Not all deviations require negotiation. Focus on
   provisions with the highest economic impact (extension conditions,
   recourse carveouts, cash sweep triggers, transfer restrictions).
5. **Propose revisions:** Draft specific language changes to move the
   provision toward the desired position, citing the market benchmark
   as support.
6. **Consider deal context:**
   - Loan-to-value and leverage: Higher leverage = less negotiating room.
   - Property type and quality: Trophy assets command better terms.
   - Sponsor/guarantor strength: Strong sponsors can push harder on
     recourse and transfer provisions.
   - Market conditions: Tight lending markets favor lenders; competitive
     markets favor borrowers.
   - Securitization intent: CMBS-bound loans are less negotiable on
     structural provisions.
   - Portfolio vs. single-asset: Portfolio loans involve additional
     complexity (cross-collateralization, release provisions, allocated
     loan amounts).
