# Construction Loan Agreement Negotiation Cheat Sheet

## How to Use This Skill

When reviewing a construction loan agreement, follow this workflow:

1. **Identify the provision** in the agreement under review and match it to the applicable section below.
2. **Compare the language** against the Lender's Desired Position, Borrower's Desired Position, and the Market Benchmark.
3. **Flag deviations** where the agreement under review is more lender-favorable or more borrower-favorable than the benchmark.
4. **Generate redline suggestions** that move the provision toward the client's desired position, citing the benchmark as a credible market reference.
5. **Note interdependencies** — budget reallocation flexibility (§1) affects cost overrun triggers (§2); change order thresholds (§5) affect budget reallocation mechanics (§1); transfer restrictions (§12) are a full recourse trigger (§8).

> **Market Benchmark Source:** A well-negotiated, large-scale construction loan agreement for a mixed-use residential condominium project in South Florida (with hotel and club components), originated by a major money-center bank. Dollar thresholds and percentage tests reflect a project of substantial scale and should be adjusted proportionally for smaller transactions.

## 1. Construction Budget Reallocations

**Concept:** The degree to which a borrower may shift funds between line items in the project budget without obtaining lender consent.

### Lender's Desired Position

- All budget reallocations require lender's prior written consent.
- No movement of funds between hard cost and soft cost categories.
- Contingency line items remain untouched without lender approval.
- Borrower cannot self-certify that "cost savings" have been realized.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Broad discretion to reallocate between line items within the same category (hard-to-hard, soft-to-soft).
- Ability to deploy contingency funds as needed without delays from lender approval cycles.
- Right to reallocate cost savings from completed line items to any other line item.
- No minimum contingency floor requirement.

### Market Benchmark

**Cost Savings to Contingency or Same-Category Line Items:** Borrower may reallocate verified Cost Savings from any hard cost line item to the Hard Cost Contingency or other hard cost line items without consent, provided Borrower delivers evidence satisfactory to Lender that the Cost Savings requirements are met. Same framework applies to soft costs, and soft cost savings may also move to hard cost line items — but not vice versa.

**Contingency Deployment (Two-Tranche Approach):**

- First 50% of contingency may be reallocated to other same-category line items without lender consent.
- Remaining 50% may be reallocated on a percentage-of-completion basis (available proportionally as the project progresses).

**Minimum Contingency Floor:** After any reallocation, the Hard Cost Contingency must remain ≥ 5% of Remaining Contingency Costs for Hard Costs, and the Soft Cost Contingency must remain ≥ 5% of Remaining Contingency Costs for Soft Costs.

**Guardrails on Reallocation:**

- No reallocation of retainage amounts until 100% of work on the line item is complete.
- No reallocation from Hard Cost Contingency to Soft Costs.
- No reallocation toward Affiliate Fees.
- No reallocation may delay any Major Milestone.
- No reallocation of amounts for mortgage recording taxes or title insurance premiums.
- Prior notice to Lender with Officer's Certificate certifying Total Contingency relative to Remaining Contingency Costs.
- No reallocation permitted if it would prime the lien of the security instrument or adversely affect lien priority.

## 2. Cost Overrun Funding

**Concept:** The mechanism by which budget shortfalls (both carry costs and hard/soft construction costs) are identified, funded, and treated.

### Lender's Desired Position

- Lender has sole discretion to determine when a shortfall exists.
- Borrower must fund overruns immediately from out-of-pocket equity.
- Shortfall deposits are treated as additional collateral under lender's sole control.
- Failure to fund is an immediate Event of Default with no cure period.
- Lender has no obligation to advance further until the loan is "back in balance."

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Shortfall determinations require good-faith consultation with borrower and a mutual process.
- Reasonable cure periods before any default is triggered.
- Shortfall deposits disbursed back to borrower on the same terms as loan advances (not trapped).
- Right to satisfy shortfalls through direct payments to contractors rather than deposits to reserve accounts.
- Shortfall Factors (cap payments, excess cash flow, contract deposits, etc.) should be credited against any shortfall.

### Market Benchmark

**Two Separate Shortfall Mechanisms:**

- Carry Cost Shortfall: Covers interest, taxes, insurance, and operating carry during construction.
- Construction Cost Shortfall: Covers all non-carry Approved Project Costs (hard and soft costs).

**Determination Standard:** Lender determines carry cost shortfalls in its sole but good faith discretion and construction cost shortfalls in its sole discretion, in each case after accounting for Shortfall Factors (remaining loan advances, mezzanine advances, Cost Savings, cap agreement payments, and reserve balances).

**Funding Timeline:** Borrower must deposit shortfall amounts from out-of-pocket Borrower equity within 15 Business Days of Lender's written notice.

**Direct Payment Alternative:** If, prior to expiration of the 15-Business Day period, Borrower makes a direct payment from out-of-pocket equity for the costs underlying the shortfall and provides satisfactory evidence, the reserve deposit is not required — provided no shortfall then exists. This is a significant liquidity benefit for borrowers.

**Treatment of Deposits:** Held in Eligible Accounts under Lender's control. Disbursed in the same manner as loan Advances (subject to same conditions precedent), meaning Borrower gets credit but does not have free access.

**Default Trigger:** Failure to fund within 15 Business Days of notice = immediate Event of Default (no additional cure period).

**Advance Lockout:** Lender has no obligation to make further Advances until shortfall is cured and the loan is "back in balance."

---

## 3. Substantial Completion Definition and Deadline

**Concept:** What constitutes "substantial completion" of the project, the deadline by which it must occur, and the extent of force majeure relief.

### Lender's Desired Position

- Extensive multi-element definition requiring full governmental sign-off, all utilities, lien waivers, CO issuance, and condominium conversion.
- Hard deadline with no extensions except for narrowly defined force majeure.
- Short aggregate cap on force majeure extensions.
- Exclude financial inability from force majeure.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Substantial completion defined primarily by architect's certificate (AIA G704) and temporary CO.
- Generous punchlist carve-outs.
- Broad force majeure definition with long aggregate cap.
- Separate completion deadlines for each component to avoid cross-default.

### Market Benchmark

**Substantial Completion Definition (11 elements):**

1. Construction complete except for Punchlist Items, substantially in accordance with Plans and Specifications.
2. Delivery of AIA Form G704 (Certificate of Substantial Completion) executed by Borrower's Architect.
3. All fixtures and equipment installed or on-site and ready for installation.
4. All utilities connected and operational.
5. All construction requirements under Leases and Unit Sale Contracts satisfied.
6. *(Intentionally omitted — available for project-specific requirements).*
7. Fire marshal and all other governmental approvals for lawful use and occupancy obtained.
8. Final and unconditional lien waivers from all Contractors and Subcontractors (or disputed amounts fully bonded).
9. Temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy issued.
10. All violations against the Property removed.
11. Condominium conversion completed.

All conditions must be evidenced to the reasonable satisfaction of Lender and Construction Consultant.

**For Purposes of the Completion Guaranty:** Substantial Completion includes completion of any Specialty Work (broader standard than the general agreement definition, which excludes Specialty Work).

**Major Milestone Deadlines (illustrative structure for a project of this scale):**

- Early Start Work Agreement executed: approximately 2 months post-closing.
- GMP Milestone satisfied: approximately 6 months post-closing.
- Substantial Completion (specific components): approximately 36 months post-closing.
- Substantial Completion (entire Project): approximately 36 months post-closing.
- Final Completion (entire Project): approximately 42 months post-closing.

**Force Majeure Carve-Outs:**

- Included events: Acts of war; riots; casualty/condemnation; floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, other acts of God; governmental preemption (national emergency); unavailability of materials (beyond Borrower's control); strikes/lockouts/labor trouble; other events beyond Borrower's or property/construction manager's control.
- Excluded: Insolvency, bankruptcy, or lack of funds of Borrower, Guarantor, Sponsor, any Restricted Party, or Affiliates (unless caused solely by Lender's breach of its funding obligations).
- Notice Requirement: Written notice to Lender within 10 Business Days of Borrower becoming aware.
- Aggregate Cap: Extensions for Force Majeure may not exceed 90 days in the aggregate across the entire loan term.

---

## 4. Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and Contractor Bonding

**Concept:** Requirements around entering into a GMP contract with the general contractor and bonding obligations for major subcontractors.

### Lender's Desired Position

- GMP must be locked in early as a condition to significant advances.
- 100% buyout of all trades required before major construction draws.
- Payment and performance bonds required from all subcontractors above a de minimis threshold.
- Pre-approved list of acceptable replacement general contractors.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Flexibility on timing of GMP execution relative to initial advances.
- GMP milestone tied to a specified buyout percentage, not 100%.
- Bonding limited to major subcontractors only, with borrower discretion on which subs qualify.
- Right to replace GC without lender consent if replacement is from a pre-approved list.

### Market Benchmark

**GMP Milestone Definition (4 elements, all must be satisfied):**

1. General Contractor's Agreement entered into (including GMP Amendment).
2. Subcontractors engaged representing ≥ 75% of trade value under the GC Agreement (including all Major Subcontractors).
3. Will-serve letters and Assignment of General Contractor's Agreement delivered.
4. All discretionary Required Building Permits and additional Construction Permits obtained.

**GMP as a Condition Precedent:** GMP Milestone satisfaction is a condition precedent to construction draws beyond pre-development work. This is standard and generally non-negotiable.

**Payment and Performance Bonds:** Borrower must cause dual-obligee payment and performance bonds to be maintained at 100% of the applicable sub-contract amount for each Major Subcontractor as reasonably determined by Lender.

**Contractor Replacement:** Pre-approved replacement GC listed on a schedule to the agreement. Replacement with a non-listed person requires Lender's reasonable discretion approval; replacement with a Borrower/Guarantor Affiliate requires sole and absolute discretion approval.

---

## 5. Change Order Approval Thresholds

**Concept:** The dollar and qualitative thresholds that determine whether a change order requires lender approval.

### Lender's Desired Position

- All change orders require lender consent.
- Low dollar thresholds for individual and aggregate change orders.
- Broad qualitative triggers (any design, structural, or scope change).

### Borrower's Desired Position

- High per-change-order threshold for lender approval.
- High aggregate cap before lender involvement.
- Non-Material Change Orders processed without consent, with after-the-fact notice only.
- Qualitative triggers limited to genuinely material changes.

### Market Benchmark

**General Rule:** All Change Orders and deviations from Plans and Specifications, Construction Schedule, or Project Budget require Lender's prior written consent in sole discretion.

**Non-Material Change Orders:** Borrower may permit Change Orders that are not Material Change Orders without consent, provided copies are delivered to Lender and Construction Consultant with the next Draw Request (or simultaneously). This is the key borrower carve-out — the definition of "Material Change Order" is where the real negotiation happens.

**Material Change Order Triggers (any one triggers lender approval):**

1. Materials, fixtures, or equipment not at least equal quality to approved Plans and Specifications.
2. Material change in architectural/structural design, value, scope, character, intended use, layout, or quality.
3. Increase of ≥ $450,000 for any single Change Order (together with all related Change Orders).
4. Would cause the aggregate additional cost of all Change Orders effectuated without consent to equal or exceed $3,500,000.
5. Materially affects a structural element, building system, or exterior, or materially and adversely affects operating systems.
6. Inconsistent with any Unit Sale Contract, Property Document, Lease, or Material Agreement, or would give counterparties termination/modification rights.
7. Reduces floor area, rentable or saleable square footage in any material manner.
8. Reasonably expected to delay any Major Milestone.
9. Requires consent of any non-Affiliated third party.
10. Results from or relates to a Hotel Management Agreement.
11. Contravenes Legal Requirements.

> **Scaling Note:** The $450K individual / $3.5M aggregate thresholds reflect a large-scale project. For smaller projects, expect proportionally lower thresholds (e.g., $50K–$150K individual / $500K–$1.5M aggregate).

---

## 6. Funding for Stored Materials

**Concept:** Conditions under which the lender will advance loan proceeds for materials purchased but not yet installed.

### Lender's Desired Position

- No advances for stored materials unless strictly necessary.
- Materials must be on-site, identified, segregated, and insured.
- Lender must have a perfected first-priority security interest.
- Hard dollar cap on aggregate stored materials.
- Separate, stricter treatment for prefabrication deposits (materials not yet fabricated).

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Flexibility to store materials off-site (e.g., at fabrication facilities).
- Higher or no cap on stored material advances.
- Prefabrication deposits treated the same as stored materials.
- Minimal additional documentation requirements.

### Market Benchmark

**Stored Materials Requirements:**

- Must be (A) identified to the Property and Borrower, segregated to give notice of Borrower's title; (B) stored at the Property or at a third-party site reasonably approved by Lender, protected against theft and damage in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Lender; and (C) insured for full replacement cost.
- Lender has a first-priority security interest in stored materials.
- Aggregate cap: $15,000,000 for on-site and off-site stored materials at any one time (higher amounts require Lender's sole discretion approval).

**Prefabrication Deposits (separate, stricter treatment):**

- Advances permitted for deposits toward materials not yet fully fabricated and materials for which title has not yet passed to Borrower.
- Aggregate cap on prefabrication deposit advances (including any mezzanine advances) at any time determined by Lender after consultation with Borrower and Construction Consultant.
- Includes a sub-cap on advances for materials to be produced outside the United States (determined by Lender and Construction Consultant).

> **Scaling Note:** The $15M stored materials cap reflects a large-scale project. For smaller projects, expect caps in the $2M–$5M range.

---

## 7. Delay Liquidated Damages and Contractor Replacement Rights

**Concept:** Remedies available when the general contractor defaults, becomes insolvent, or causes delays, including the right to terminate and replace the contractor.

### Lender's Desired Position

- Lender can direct borrower to terminate the GC at any time during an Event of Default.
- Lender has sole discretion over replacement contractor selection.
- Lender has full right to step in and complete construction itself ("right to complete").
- All termination fees and costs borne by Borrower.
- No limitation on Lender's discretion once it exercises step-in rights.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Contractor termination only for cause (contractor default or insolvency), not for borrower Events of Default.
- Borrower selects replacement from pre-approved list without further consent.
- Lender's right to complete is limited and requires acceleration first.
- Force Majeure-related delays do not trigger contractor replacement rights.
- If Lender directs termination over Borrower's objection, the resulting costs and delays should not be counted against Borrower.

### Market Benchmark

**Mandatory Termination Triggers (at Lender's request):**

1. Event of Default under the Loan exists and is continuing.
2. GC becomes subject to a Bankruptcy Action or insolvency.
3. Default under the construction contract beyond all notice and cure periods.

**Replacement Requirements:**

- Replacement with a pre-approved person from a schedule to the agreement, or any other person approved by Lender in its reasonable discretion (sole discretion if the replacement is a Borrower/Guarantor Affiliate).
- Replacement agreement must be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender.
- Assignment and subordination of replacement agreement to Lender required.
- No Shortfall may exist after the replacement (or Borrower must cure).
- Each Major Milestone must remain achievable post-replacement.

**Borrower Protection (key negotiated point):** If termination was directed by Lender due to a contractor default beyond Borrower's control and Borrower did not agree with the termination, then the resulting costs and delays receive favorable treatment and are not counted against Borrower for shortfall/milestone purposes.

**Lender's Right to Complete:** Upon acceleration, Lender may enter the Property, cause Final Completion with changes as Lender deems appropriate, assume Borrower's obligations under project documents, engage new contractors, amend/terminate contracts, and settle claims — all at Borrower's sole risk, cost, and expense.

**GC Agreement Modifications:** Require Lender's reasonable discretion (better for Borrower than sole discretion).

## 8. Scope of Carve-Out Guaranties ("Bad Boy" Acts)

**Concept:** The acts or omissions that trigger personal recourse liability for the borrower and/or guarantor, either as "springing" full recourse or as loss-based carve-outs.

### Lender's Desired Position

- Expansive list of bad-boy acts triggering full recourse.
- Loss-based carve-outs with broad definitions and no dollar caps.
- No exceptions or safe harbors for borrower.
- Include operational failures (failure to pay taxes, maintain insurance, etc.) as loss carve-outs.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Narrow list of truly "bad" acts for full recourse (voluntary bankruptcy, fraud only).
- Loss carve-outs limited to actual, out-of-pocket losses (excluding special, punitive, consequential damages).
- Safe harbors where funds are available but Lender fails to disburse.
- Qualifiers on operational carve-outs (e.g., no liability if Lender controls cash flow and doesn't apply it).
- Temporal limitations tying carve-outs to the carry guarantee period.

### Market Benchmark

**Loss-Based Carve-Outs:** Borrower is personally liable for actual out-of-pocket Losses (excluding special, punitive, incidental, treble, and consequential damages — except for third-party claims against Lender) arising from:

1. Fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or willful misconduct.
2. Intentional physical waste — with extensive safe harbors: no liability if (I) sufficient cash flow exists and Lender doesn't permit its application, (II) Lender holds reserved funds and doesn't apply them, (III) Advances are available and Lender fails to make them, or (IV) post-Substantial Completion, insufficient cash flow exists to fix the condition.
3. Intentional removal/disposal of Property during EOD (excluding normal-course replacements).
4. Misappropriation/conversion of Insurance Proceeds, Awards, Rents, Advances, Sales Proceeds, security deposits, key money, or other monetary collateral.
5. Failure to deliver security deposits/contract deposits to Lender upon foreclosure (except if properly applied per the Agreement).
6. Failure to pay taxes, maintain insurance, or pay lien-creating charges — same safe harbors as waste apply. Liability terminates when Guarantor's carry cost guaranty obligations end.
7. Criminal forfeiture of the Property.
8. Failure to permit on-site inspections after written request and 48 hours' notice.
9. SPE violations (breach of single-purpose entity covenants).
10. ERISA/Withdrawal Liability.
11. Unauthorized Indebtedness.
12. Unauthorized amendment of Condominium Documents, Master Covenants, or REA.
13. Unauthorized Unit sales (including brokerage commissions and release price shortfalls).
14. Unauthorized Hotel Management Agreement changes (including unamortized key money).
15. Liquor License failures (with protections for Lender's failure to fund).
16. Failure to comply with Guarantor reporting requirements (30-day cure period after notice).
17. Developer/Declarant liabilities under Offering Plan/Condominium Documents — with notable carve-back: if Lender assumed Borrower's GC assignment, Borrower has no liability for construction defects unless Lender (x) assigns back the claim, (y) permits Borrower to pursue on Lender's behalf, or (z) uses commercially reasonable efforts to pursue the claim for 120 days without resolution.
18. Pre-existing Affiliate indemnification obligations surviving equity foreclosure.
19. Failure to maintain Interest Rate Cap Agreement.
20. Unauthorized Transfers (excluding failure to send notice for otherwise-permitted transfers).
21. Employment liabilities arising from non-compliance with labor/employment laws.
22. Land Trust cessation or unauthorized modification.
23. Failure to pay transfer taxes in connection with UCC Foreclosure (with advance offset).
24. Unauthorized amendment/termination of mezzanine or subordinate loan documents.

**Full Recourse Triggers:** Borrower is personally liable for the entire Debt upon:

1. Voluntary bankruptcy filing by Borrower, Pledgor, or Guarantor.
2. Consenting to or supporting involuntary bankruptcy.
3. Consenting to appointment of receiver/trustee.
4. Assignment for benefit of creditors or admission of insolvency.
5. Seeking substantive consolidation.
6. Frivolous or bad-faith defenses (determined by final non-appealable judgment).
7. Prohibited Transfer resulting in Minimum Hold/Control Requirements failing.
8. SPE breach cited by court as basis for substantive consolidation.
9. Opting out of UCC Article 8.
10. Asserting Loan Documents invalid/unenforceable.
11. Unauthorized surrender/transfer to mezzanine or subordinate lender.

> **Key Negotiation Wins to Preserve:** The waste/tax/insurance safe harbors (no liability when Lender controls funds and doesn't apply them) and the construction defect carve-back (no liability when Lender has assumed GC rights) are high-value borrower protections that lenders frequently resist. Push hard to retain these.

---

## 9. Guarantor Release Conditions

**Concept:** The ongoing financial covenants guarantors must maintain and the circumstances under which guarantors may be released or replaced.

### Lender's Desired Position

- Stringent financial covenants with no cure mechanism.
- Guarantor breach is an immediate Event of Default.
- No release of guarantors during the life of the loan.
- Supplemental guarantors must be acceptable to Lender in sole discretion.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Financial covenant breach triggers a cure period, not immediate default.
- Ability to substitute guarantors with qualified affiliates.
- Release upon project stabilization, refinancing, or sale.
- Non-defaulting guarantor can satisfy covenants independently if one guarantor fails.

### Market Benchmark

**Guarantor Financial Covenants:** Guarantors must collectively maintain at all times specified net worth and liquidity thresholds (set forth in the Guaranty of Recourse Obligations as a separate instrument).

**Cure Period:** Failure is curable within 30 days after written notice from Lender. During the cure period:

- Lender has no obligation to make Advances.
- All Approved Project Costs must be funded 100% from Borrower equity.

**Non-Defaulting Guarantor Safe Harbor:** No Event of Default exists if, within 5 Business Days of notice, Lender receives evidence that at least one Non-Defaulting Guarantor independently satisfies the Financial Covenants without counting assets or liquidity of the Defaulting Guarantor. For non-financial reporting defaults, the Defaulting Guarantor's decision-making and control rights must also be permanently suspended.

**Supplemental Guarantor Mechanism:** Borrower may cure by delivering supplemental guaranties from an Affiliate of a Non-Defaulting Guarantor:

- Supplemental Guarantor must be acceptable to Lender (consent not unreasonably withheld if the person satisfies Financial Covenants in aggregate with Non-Defaulting Guarantor and passes KYC).
- Must deliver supplemental versions of Environmental Indemnity and all Guaranties in form identical to originals.
- Supplemental Guarantor and original Guarantor are jointly and severally liable (both pre- and post-supplement obligations).
- All Borrower entities and Non-Defaulting Guarantor must deliver reaffirmations.
- Deadline: 30 days following Non-Defaulting Guarantor's knowledge of the Event of Default.

**Minimum Hold/Control Requirements:** Principal guarantors must maintain specified minimum indirect ownership percentages (benchmark: approximately 15%–25% for the lead sponsor, 10%–15% for a secondary sponsor), and an Approved Control Person must maintain Control of the Borrower at all times.

---

## 10. Environmental Indemnity Scope and Survival

**Concept:** The breadth of the environmental indemnity and how long it survives repayment of the loan.

### Lender's Desired Position

- Broad indemnity covering all Environmental Statutes (federal, state, local, common law).
- Joint and several liability of Borrower and all Guarantors.
- Unlimited survival period (survives repayment and release of lien).
- Not affected by exculpation provisions.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Limited to conditions arising during Borrower's ownership period.
- Narrower definition of Environmental Statutes.
- Survival period capped (e.g., tied to statute of limitations for environmental claims).
- Indemnity terminates upon loan repayment or foreclosure.

### Market Benchmark

**Separate Agreement:** Environmental Indemnity is a standalone agreement executed by Borrower and all Guarantors.

**Scope:** Covers all "Environmental Statutes," defined expansively to include CERCLA, RCRA, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, TSCA, Safe Drinking Water Act, OSHA, FIFRA, Endangered Species Act, NEPA, Rivers and Harbors Act, lead-based paint laws, all state/local analogs, plus common law claims (nuisance, trespass, wrongful death, personal injury, property damage). Also covers transfer-related environmental disclosures, permit conditions, and remediation obligations.

**Carve from Exculpation:** Expressly carved out from the non-recourse exculpation provisions. The Environmental Indemnity is fully enforceable regardless of the borrower's non-recourse protections.

**Survival:** Survives repayment of the Loan, release of the Security Instrument lien, and any foreclosure or enforcement action. Specific survival period set forth in the Environmental Indemnity Agreement itself (typically perpetual or tied to applicable statutes of limitation/repose for environmental claims).

> **Practical Note:** Environmental indemnity scope is rarely negotiable in any meaningful way. Focus negotiation energy on ensuring the indemnity is limited to conditions first arising or existing during Borrower's ownership, and carving out conditions caused by Lender or its agents.

---

## 11. Completion Guaranty Burn-Off Triggers

**Concept:** The conditions under which the guarantor's obligation to guarantee completion of the project is extinguished.

### Lender's Desired Position

- Completion Guaranty survives until Final Completion plus resolution of all punchlist items, lien waivers, and governmental approvals.
- Include Specialty Work within the completion guaranty obligation.
- No early burn-off; guaranty terminates only upon full satisfaction of all completion conditions.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Burn-off at Substantial Completion (not Final Completion).
- Specialty Work excluded from completion guaranty.
- Punchlist items handled through retainage, not personal guaranty.
- Clear, objective triggers for burn-off.

### Market Benchmark

**Completion Guaranty Standard:** The Completion Guaranty is a separate guaranty instrument. The loan agreement provides key definitional parameters:

- For purposes of the Completion Guaranty, "Substantial Completion" **includes completion of any Specialty Work** (broader standard than the general agreement definition, which excludes Specialty Work).
- The Guarantor remains on the hook for Specialty Work items that may extend beyond the general Substantial Completion date.

**Practical Burn-Off:** The Completion Guaranty typically burns off upon achievement of all elements of Substantial Completion (as defined for guaranty purposes, including Specialty Work) plus Final Completion (all punchlist items resolved, final lien waivers delivered, final CO obtained). In the benchmark agreement, Final Completion must occur approximately 42 months post-closing, subject to a 90-day aggregate Force Majeure extension.

> **Negotiation Strategy:** The inclusion of Specialty Work in the Completion Guaranty definition is a significant lender protection. Borrowers should push for either (a) exclusion of Specialty Work from the guaranty definition, (b) a separate Specialty Work completion deadline with its own cure provisions, or (c) a retainage holdback mechanism as an alternative to personal guaranty exposure for Specialty Work.

---

## 12. Transfer Restrictions

**Concept:** Limitations on direct and indirect transfers of interests in the borrower, the property, and related entities.

### Lender's Desired Position

- All transfers require prior written consent.
- Broad definition of "Transfer" covering direct and indirect interests at every ownership tier.
- No carve-outs for estate planning, passive investors, or affiliates.
- Any prohibited transfer is an Event of Default triggering full recourse.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Permitted transfers for estate planning (trusts, family members).
- Passive investor transfers without consent (indirect, minority interests).
- Publicly traded stock transfers exempt.
- Transfers to affiliates that maintain control and meet KYC requirements permitted without consent.
- Change of control only triggered by transfer of direct interests in the borrower entity.

### Market Benchmark

**General Prohibition:** No sale, encumbrance, pledge, change of control, or disposition of the Property, any interest therein, or any interest in any Restricted Party (at any tier) without Lender's prior written consent.

**Permitted Transfers (without Lender consent):**

1. Indirect interests in Restricted Parties (other than direct interests in the Project Party).
2. Publicly traded stock on NYSE or recognized U.S. exchange.
3. Estate planning transfers by natural persons: to spouse, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, niece, nephew, aunt, uncle, or trusts for their benefit.
4. Mezzanine lender enforcement actions.
5. Condominium conversion-related transfers.

**Conditions for All Permitted Transfers:**

- Minimum Hold/Control Requirements must remain satisfied (specified ownership percentages maintained; Approved Control Person retains Control).
- 20-day prior notice to Lender (10 days post-death for estate transfers).
- Transferee not entitled to preferential Unit purchase rights.
- No felony convictions (misdemeanors excluding moral turpitude acceptable).
- No Embargoed Person or Politically Exposed Person.
- No bankruptcy filing within 7 years (if transferee will obtain Control).
- No SPE violations.
- For transferees acquiring ≥ 10% interest (or obtaining Control): customary KYC searches and Lender confirmation.

**Bright Line:** No transfer of direct ownership interests in the Project Party is permitted without Lender's prior written consent in its sole discretion. This is generally non-negotiable.

**Prohibited Transfer = Full Recourse:** Any prohibited Transfer resulting in Minimum Hold/Control Requirements failing is a full recourse trigger.

---

## 13. Material Contract and Lease Approval Rights

**Concept:** Lender's approval rights over leases and major contracts at the property.

### Lender's Desired Position

- All leases and material agreements require prior written consent in sole discretion.
- No deemed approval mechanism.
- Expansive definition of Material Agreements covering any contract above a low threshold.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Approval standard of "not unreasonably withheld" for commercial leases.
- Deemed approval mechanism if Lender fails to respond within a set period.
- No approval required for leases/contracts below a materiality threshold.
- Sole discretion limited to truly extraordinary actions (franchise agreements, hotel management).

### Market Benchmark

**Leases:**

- All Leases (and renewals, amendments, modifications) require Lender's prior consent (except transient hotel occupancy).
- Approval standard: sole but good faith discretion.
- Deemed Approval Mechanism: Consent deemed granted if Borrower delivers proper two-stage notice — Initial Notice (with bold-letter warning language) + 10 Business Day response period → Second Notice (with bold-letter final warning) + 5 Business Day response period. Any request by Lender for more information resets the clock.

**Approval Standards by Contract Type:**

| Contract Type | Approval Standard |
|---|---|
| Leases (all) | Sole but good faith discretion; deemed approval available |
| Management Agreements (non-Hotel) | Not unreasonably withheld |
| Hotel Management Agreement | Sole and absolute discretion |
| General Contractor's Agreement | Sole discretion to enter into; reasonable discretion for modifications |
| Major Construction Contracts (non-GC) | Not unreasonably withheld (sole discretion if counterparty is Borrower Affiliate) |
| Sales Agency Agreement | Not unreasonably withheld |
| Franchise Agreements / Rental Programs | Sole and absolute discretion |
| All contracts during EOD | Sole discretion |

---

## 14. Cash Management and Lockbox Waterfall Mechanics

**Concept:** The structure for collecting, holding, and distributing property revenues and sales proceeds during the loan term.

### Lender's Desired Position

- Hard lockbox from day one with all revenues swept to lender-controlled account.
- Lender has sole dominion and control of all accounts.
- Strict waterfall with debt service paid before any distributions to borrower.
- All excess cash trapped.
- Lender discretion to redirect all funds during an Event of Default.

### Borrower's Desired Position

- Soft lockbox or springing lockbox (lockbox activates only upon certain triggers).
- Borrower retains operating accounts with reasonable autonomy.
- Operating expenses paid before debt service.
- Excess cash released to borrower if no shortfall exists.
- Specific line items for approved budgeted items to flow without friction.

### Market Benchmark

**Structure:** Hard lockbox with Clearing Account sweeping all revenues to a lender-controlled Cash Management Account at the Deposit Bank. Lender has sole dominion and control.

**Operating Revenue Waterfall (monthly on each Payment Date):**

1. **First:** Tax and Insurance Escrow deposits.
2. **Second:** Clearing Bank and Deposit Bank fees and expenses.
3. **Third:** Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount.
4. **Fourth:** Operating expenses per Approved Annual Budget or Project Budget + approved Extraordinary Expenses + Emergency Expenses. Subject to Borrower's delivery of an Officer's Certificate with detailed expense list and quarterly reconciliation. Amounts previously disbursed but not used are clawed back. Lender has no obligation to disburse without the Officer's Certificate (delivered at least 5 Business Days prior).
5. **Fifth:** All other amounts due to Lender/Servicer under Loan Documents (including supplemental fees).
6. **Sixth:** Mezzanine debt service and other mezzanine loan amounts.
7. **Seventh:** All remaining amounts ("Excess Cash") swept to the Excess Cash Reserve Account.

2. **Second:** Any Carry Cost Shortfall Payment.
3. **Thereafter:** Remaining amounts (after full repayment) to Borrower.

**Event of Default Override:** Upon EOD, Lender may apply all Cash Management Account funds in any order and priority as Lender determines in its sole discretion until the Debt is repaid in full.

**Working Capital Account:** Post-Substantial Completion, Lender disburses a modest amount (benchmark: $150,000) into a Borrower-owned working capital account for operating expenses, payroll, and property manager costs per the approved budget. Replenished via Advances subject to documentation of proper use.

## Key Defined Terms Reference

When reviewing a construction loan agreement against this cheat sheet, watch for these critical defined terms and ensure they are properly calibrated:

- **Approved Project Costs** — All costs in the Project Budget approved for loan funding.
- **Borrower Equity Payment** — Borrower's co-investment alongside each Advance.
- **Borrower Related Party** — Borrower and all Affiliates, managers, officers, directors (scope matters for carve-out guaranty exposure).
- **Cost Savings** — Verified savings on completed or bought-out line items (requires lien waivers, contractor certifications, and Lender/Construction Consultant satisfaction).
- **Major Milestone** — Time-gated construction milestones; breach is an Event of Default.
- **Material Change Order** — Threshold definition (benchmark: $450K individual / $3.5M aggregate, plus qualitative tests). Scale to project size.
- **Minimum Hold/Control Requirements** — Minimum ownership percentages and Control requirements that must be maintained at all times.
- **Remaining Contingency Costs** — Costs yet to be incurred through Final Completion (denominator for the 5% contingency floor).
- **Shortfall Factors** — Credits against shortfall calculations (cap payments, excess cash flow, contract deposits, Cost Savings, etc.). Ensure the definition is broad enough to capture all sources of liquidity.
